: Sir! Sir! What say you to the fact that our families are snapping in half,
 sir? I say to you what I have said a thousand times, and that is this:
 tradition is the glue which holds magical society together! When you burn
 away tradition, sweeping it off with Muggle machines and cold numbers,
 then you dissolve the ties which bind magical Britain! I myself have visited
 the Registrars of Marriages and Unions of Godric's Hollow and Diagon Alley,
 to name only two, and I am told that they have seen twice as many divorces
 this year as they saw in 1989! Twice as many! Homes are being broken, children
 are finding themselves Flooing back and forth on alternate weeks, and happy
 unions are being destroyed in the wake of all this haphazard and destructive
 change.
 So I ask you then, what say you to that?

 First, I believe that you show the same care for metaphor as you do for
 logic.
 Are we burning, sweeping, or dissolving? And if we're burning, how do we
 do that with cold numbers? Clear articulation is a sign of clear thought,
 and vice-versa.

“I know it's a bit unfair,” Hermione Granger said, staring at the five Honourabl
e, “but it certainly does seem that we tend to find you lot in skeevy little
 places, doing skeevy little things.” She glanced pointedly down at the floor,
 where trickles of golden potion were slowly spreading around under the
 feet of Margaret Bulstrode, Edgar Erasmus, Geoffrey Gem, and his two assistants.
 She could smell the shrivelfig.
 Euphoria Elixir.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Auror Kwannon?” Hermione called over her shoulder, past where Hyori was
 standing at the door.
 The Returned witch stepped aside to admit the auror, without ever taking
 her eyes or wand or glower off of the captured wizards and witches.
 Kwannon also had to edge past the gentleman she'd brought with her from
 the 
\noun on
dmle
\noun default
, Gerald.
 He was some sort of recorder, taking notes of raids like this one.
 An ineffectual attempt at holding aurors accountable, Hermione thought.
 Kwannon looked irritated at the whole production.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
The aurors feel like they should be running the show, first through the
 door.
 But there's just no reason to let them take those kind of risks, not when
 I'm here
\emph default
, she thought.
 She glanced over at the auror again.
 Kwannon was relatively tall, considering her Japanese heritage, with a
 round face, a scattering of light freckles, and a flat nose.
 She was one of Alastor's, and was usually in the Tower.
 For the time being, though, she was here on Harry's behalf, along with
 four more aurors from the 
\noun on

\noun default
.
 Harry had needed someone here, after all – needed some eyes and ears on
 her Honourable hunt… what would he do with himself otherwise, locked up
 in that Tower and buried in healing and research, if he couldn't divert
 himself with some crude manipulations of everyone around him?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Not that manipulation, per se, was her complaint.
 It was just… Harry never 
\emph on
learned
\emph default
.
 After their first year, including the trial and the troll and that terrible
 time at the end, he never really changed.
 He just became more… well, Harry-like.
 He hadn't learned the real lesson she thought he'd take away: if you try
 to use secret knowledge to manipulate complex situations about which you
 have incomplete information, then things will get very bad, very quickly.
 It was very hard for any person to be smart enough to manage that – and
 it was stupid to try when you had 
\emph on
friends

.
 It was “nihil supernum,” after all, not “nihil par.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

But the stubborn man hadn't learned then, and so Walpurgisnacht had happened,

 Even after the price we paid.

 Hermione almost lifted her hand to touch her neck, but stopped as she realized
 what she was doing.
 No time for this sort of dithering.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She brought her thoughts back to the present situation.
 
\emph on
Time for me to butt out a bit.
 I'll make myself her asset, rather than her superior.
 She's probably better at this than I, anyway.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Auror Kwannon, this isn't really my sort of thing,” she said, turning and
 smiling at the auror, slightly lifting her shoulders to indicate her ignorance
 about the next proper thing to do.
 “You were kind enough to let me pop through here quickly, to keep the miscreant
s here… maybe you could take the lead from here?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Yes, well…” said the auror, looking around the room before focusing back
 in on the five Honourable.
 “This is some trouble, here.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Gem noticeably shrank back into himself, seeming almost to fold his thin
 body over.
 The witch and wizard that were his assistants took things a little bit
 more in stride – as though stunned and out of place, with confused expressions.
 Hermione was fairly sure they were still riding down a dose of Euphoria.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Erasmus, on the other hand, puffed up his chest.
 He was red in the face, and with the colouring of his hair, he looked humorousl
y similar to a large carrot.
 “There's no crime in printing and distributing a newsletter, or in conducting
 private researches, I think.
 Even in today's Britain!”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Kwannon turned her sharp attention to the researcher.
 “Mr.
 Erasmus, you are correct.
 However, it is illegal to operate a private Floo network, it is illegal
 to conduct dangerous research within one hundred meters of a residence,
 and it is extremely illegal to sell Euphoric Elixir without a license.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“All unjust prohibitions!” said Erasmus.
 He had brilliant blue eyes that were narrowed in indignation.
 To emphasize his point, he thumped his fist down on the stack of boxes
 he'd been carrying when Hermione had torn up the entrance hatch and knocked
 down their door.
 “Who is the Government to say what I do with a Floo, where I can do my
 research, or what potions I brew, eh? My research is my research!”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I recall your research, sir,” said Kwannon, her mouth tight.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The former Tower researcher had been studying the construction of magical
 machines, Hermione recalled, before he had been fired, his research confiscated
, and key memories Obliviated.
 Erasmus had ignored safety concerns entirely, and had insisted on just
 bullying through and continuing to build his wind-machines.
 They used fluid dynamics: tight swirls of air spinning as gears, fed by
 small warming columns of heat from below; flywheels of pressurized zones
 to store and transfer energy; and shifts between small turbulent flows
 and laminar flows as switches.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The machines had been brilliant – Erasmus was brilliant – but they had also
 been maddeningly dangerous.
 One 
\emph on
Ventus
\emph default
 could power them for days, and the 
\emph on
very first
\emph default
 thing they were designed to do was consume waste matter of 
\emph on
any type
\emph default
 and incinerate it for more power.
 If Erasmus had moved his investigations of Muggle science out of engineering
 and aerodynamics, and into something like computer programming… the danger
 had been unbelievable, even by magical standards.
 He was almost a cartoonish figure: the mad scientist with no concern for
 consequences.
 Harry had not only been apoplectic, he'd been outright offended.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hermione supposed that the setbacks they'd given Erasmus, including the
 changes to his memory, were probably enough to ensure everyone's safety.
 But to see him right back at it, only now without any supervision… they'd
 need to do something, somehow.
 It needed thought.
 For now, at least, it looked like Erasmus wouldn't be a danger for a while.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“In the States, anyone can set up a Floo.
 It's not right that there's only one Floo Network in Britain,” offered
 Margaret Bulstrode.
 She was a beautiful young woman, but clearly quite out of her depth.
 Hermione knew Margaret, slightly – she'd been several years ahead at Hogwarts,
 and the aurors in charge of investigating the Diagon bombing had brought
 her before the Wizengamot for examination on the basis of an informant's
 accusations.
 Nothing had come of it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I wouldn't know about that, I'm afraid,” said Kwannon, her voice hard.
 “But I do know it's illegal here, just like Faux Floo is illegal.
 Is that the genuine two-Sickles-a-scoop on your mantel?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Yes,” said Erasmus, puffing out his cheeks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Mm,” said Kwannon, noncommittally.
 She walked around the room, looking sharply into corners and at everything
 around.
 “What else you have here, eh? Come on, Gerald.” She headed through the other
 door, into a hallway or another room.
 Gerald followed her with his floating parchment and Quotes Quill, looking
 nervous.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“This is a private facility,” called out the weasely Gem, hugging himself.
 He'd put down the crate he'd been holding.
 “You have no call to go snooping…” He trailed off, uneasily.
 His fear of the Goddess and Hermione's supernatural air of innocence were
 probably confusing him.
 That sometimes happened.

“She's an auror,” said Hermione.
 “The Tower and I have proper search warrants and

 For now, you're stuck with the traditional system, as we found it.

Erasmus huffed again.
 “Under any system of justice, Muggle or magical, this is out of order.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hermione approached him.
 “How so? I'd be interested to hear you defend this, Edgar.” She gestured
 at the crate of broken potion, and clasped her hands in front of herself.
 “Did your research ever lead you to encounter the notion of ‘wireheading,'
 I wonder?”

 Hermione smiled again, and turned to face Bulstrode.
 She approached very close, and stared at the woman.
 She was a little taller than Margaret, and she knew she was quite intimidating.
 She let the smile fade from her face, and lifted a finger.
 She poked it into Margaret's chest, and said – coldly, now – “Don't hide
 behind loose categorizations.
 Say what you mean.
 You're being persecuted, are you?” She plucked at Margaret's robe at the
 shoulder, and then again at one of the pockets, contemptuously and dismissively
… as though the woman were a bit of lint.
 “You and all of Draco's loathsome death-worshippers, piling all your prejudices
 and ignorance up into a single lot.” She walked around Margaret as she spoke,
 and took the opportunity to surreptitiously drop a button – one she'd removed
 from Margaret's pocket, and palmed – into her own robes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I'll say what I mean, all right,” replied Margaret.
 Her voice barely shook.
 “You lot have taken over.
 And you've done a lot of good things.
 But there's a natural order to the world, and you've broken it.
 You've… you've done some of the darkest of rituals.
 It's the only way things even make sense.
 And you're eating up all the rest of the world, state by state.
 If you keep going, the world won't even be recognizable… no traditions
 left, no people thinking their own thoughts in their own ways… you want
 everyone to be the same, like the porcelain dolls that come out of the
 Tower.
 ‘Rejuvenation'...
 it's just control and replacement!”
\end_layout

“Draco has always had a silver tongue,” said Hermione, scornfully.
 
\emph on
She's just parroting back what she hears.
 This was the danger of letting things go this way, Harry… they're cementing
 in these ideas.
 It's hard enough to get people on our side, but to win over those who actually

 That I'd point out it was extravagant and risky and impractical.

 Bend before the storm, and surprise her.

“You might be right in some ways, Ms.
 Bulstrode,” she said, walking away.
 She saw Hyori raise an eyebrow from her position by the entrance, and flashed
 a quick smile at the Returned.
 Hermione turned back around to face the Honourable.
 “It's dangerous to discard a lot of traditions.

“Well, he did want to change it, yes,” Hermione said.
 “Not get rid of it.
 Harry isn't much for sports in general, I'm afraid, and I don't think he
 ever quite understood it – especially the snitch.
 Muggles have a similar sort of thing called test cricket, but I doubt Harry
 has ever played or even watched it.”

“That wasn't the Tower, that was a decision by Minister Fudge,” said Hermione.
 But when Margaret and Erasmus gave her a look, she smiled slightly.
 “But yes, he supported it.
 As I recall, though, Quidditch is doing just fine… better than ever, in
 fact, now that it's being run privately.
 Most of the same people working for it, I think.”

Kwannon returned at that moment, Gerald in tow, shaking her head.
 “Fairly plain about the research being done here, and the Euphoria being
 brewed.
 We'll get some people in here to collect all this, but I think you should
 all try to think of a good solicitor, if you know one.” She headed up to
 the entrance, and waved in the aurors who were standing idle in the corridor.
 “Come on through.
 Back rooms there… bag up the lot.
 Leave the experiments inside the circles until we can have someone bring

It was true, after all.
 They had some parchments to read.
 As they made their way out, Hermione reached into her robe and picked up
 the Everlasting Eye.
 When she'd seen Bulstrode out on the streets of Knockturn Alley, it had
 been easy enough to step aside, slip on the Cloak of Invisibility, and
 sprint on around ahead of her.
 She'd dropped the listening device into Margaret's pocket after tripping
 her with an invisible foot.

We are faced, right from the beginning, with a difficult task.
 It is a task so immense that most wizards never even notice it, any more
 than they notice their eyelids.
 Indeed, when I began this chapter, I sought out dozens of the most learned
 wizards in Britain, only to discover that no more than one or two had ever
 given any thought to the problem.
 Madame Hopkirk of the Department of Mysteries herself was able only to
 point me to three or four dusty volumes of consideration – none of which
 I could read (the obstacle was the same one previously encountered, dear
 reader, when I attempted to research the history of Hogwarts: no consideration
 is given to those for whom the Interdict is a forever-insuperable obstacle).

Subsequent conversations will allow us to piece together some basic ideas,
 if they must be rudimentary of necessity.
 So then: what is magic? The physical realization of an inner spirit? The
 action of a daemon working on one's behalf? A demand made on some hidden
 set of rules to the universe? We set our education and wits to the task
 of explaining many things we might see in magic:

The linguistic components of spells are all well-suited to the human tongue,

 The history of magic begins in Greece, as Madame Bagshot has instructed

Magic interferes with Muggle machines in some unknown way, yet to be discovered

The ability of humans to do magic varies, with most people unable to do
 any magic at all, others having only the very tiny magic of a Squib, and
 some having enough magic to cast spells.
 Many plants and animals also possess magic where others do not.

When these phenomena are fully internalized and realized, we may thus see
 that the daemon theory of which we spoke earlier must be the correct one.
 It explains all of the above conditions, as the daemons consume magic to
 live, make war on rival machines, live within the body to touch upon the
 mind, and are passed from parent to child like a Sallowfax infection.
