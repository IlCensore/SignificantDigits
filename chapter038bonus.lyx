\begin_layout Standard
“Put the samovar on,” Draco said, gesturing at the tapered silver device
 and glancing at Gregory.
 Three domovoi were visiting that evening, and they tended to be particular
 about such niceties.
 It was probably part of their unrelenting feelings of inferiority towards
 the British, as though Merlin’s heirs were to blame for their position
 on top of the Confederation or their legacy of powerful magic.
 The Russians always wanted to be treated with every little courtesy, and
 bristled at any perceived slight.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Not that Draco would have it any other way.
 It was an easy lever to use, and required nothing of him but a bit of forethoug
ht.
 Everyone should be so pliable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Gregory Goyle obliged, twisting one of the handles of the samovar.
 The device was an elegant piece, with two stylized dragon’s heads protruding
 from the top.
 It began to heat itself with a quiet hiss.
 “What’s the plan?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“You bring them in, and then go and tag their brooms.
 The Thunderer has been spreading gold around, looking for ways to co-opt
 the Honourable.
 I want to know who’s been helpful enough to be the point person for his
 emissaries,” said Draco.
 “Once you've done that -- and check out their people, see if there’s any
 opportunities there -- then you’ll join us and play the heavy.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Draco paused, then spoke to the air, curtly.
 “Dobby.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Barely a breath passed before the elf appeared, stepping out from behind
 a curtain.
 It was rude to apparate into the middle of a room, of course… proper house
 elf etiquette required a furtive entrance.
 The bedraggled little creature’s bony face was pained with anxiety.
 “Master?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Pack for a journey.
 Mother and I, both.
 Cold weather.
 Riding, formal blacks, formal greens, and lounging,” Draco commanded.
 “I’ll want to be ready to go by the time my meeting tonight is concluded.”
 He turned away, gesturing dismissively.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Yes, Master,” said Dobby, eyes wide.
 He gently stepped back behind the curtain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Will Carrow be here for the meeting?” Gregory asked, looking uncomfortable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Yes,” said Draco, giving Gregory a direct and cold look.
 
\emph on
What of it?
\emph default
, his face said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Fine,” said Gregory.
 Nothing more.
 He busied himself with arranging the furniture appropriately.
 He removed the two light wooden chairs from the room, levitating them out
 and replacing them with heavier armchairs.
 There were five of these: two set in close pairs and one separate, near
 the fire.
 Draco would take the single chair, of course, and allow the visitors to
 choose their own seats.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How the Russians arranged themselves would be valuable information.
 If two sat and one stood nearby, it would show that they were choosing
 solidarity in some respect -- usually indicating nervousness or conscious
 opposition.
 If all three sat immediately, it would show comfort and ease, suggesting
 Draco could easily advance the relationship by taking the domovoi into
 his confidence that very evening.
 If there was hesitation, the process and order in which they sat could
 be observed: who was the leader, who deferred to others, and so on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Poor little domovoi, coming to Malfoy Manor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They were necessary for the future, though -- not just entertainment.
 Draco had a significant power base in Britain and many admirers abroad
 -- the international subscriptions to 
\emph on
Unbreakable Honour
\emph default
 were almost equal to the domestic numbers -- but he’d never be a credible
 player on the world stage until he had some firmer connections with some
 of the globe’s more reliable leaders.
 Voters were all well and good, but if you wanted iron in the glove, you
 needed some of the better sort on your side.
 You needed some tyrants.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was a creak in the hallway outside, and Draco froze.
 Gregory snatched his wand up, his face hard.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“It’s I,” came the smooth voice of Amycus Carrow, “your Uncle Amycus.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Come,” said Draco.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The door opened, and Amycus Carrow entered.
 Tall and gaunt, the spymaster of the Honourable and old ally of the Malfoys
 was wearing black robes with shiny buttons, fastened tight up to his chin.
 The dark shadow of some scraggly whiskers were visible on his upper lip,
 and his hair was clipped very short.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Draco, my boy,” said Carrow.
 “So good to see you.” His eyes flickered over the length of Draco’s body,
 the way they always did -- a possessive and lingering look.
 “Nacreous liver,” he murmured, bizarrely and almost inaudibly.
 He seemed almost hungry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Hullo, Mr.
 Carrow,” said Gregory, just a touch too loudly.
 He put a smile on his face as a shield.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Carrow started slightly, as though he hadn't realized Gregory was there,
 and swiveled his head to glance at the other man.
 “Gregory,” he said in acknowledgment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As usual, Draco was forced to admire the performance of Mad-Eye Moody.
 It wasn't simply the perfection of the acting, although that was so masterful
 that not even Amycus Carrow’s nieces suspected the subterfuge (it helped
 that they were never permitted to spend much time with him, or to ever
 be alone with him: the uneasy parent’s usual precaution against an “acrohandula
”).
 No, the true magnificence of the performance was that Draco knew -- he
 
\emph on
knew
\emph default
 -- that Moody was putting on this perfect imitation of Carrow at the same
 time as he played the part of Draco’s spymaster while 
\emph on
also
\emph default
 watching out for Harry Potter’s interests 
\emph on
and
\emph default
 remaining constantly vigilant of immediate threats.
 It was the virtuoso exhibition of a masterful fanatic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Was your excursion useful, Amycus?” Draco asked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moody -- no, it was impossible to think of him as anything other than Amycus
 Carrow -- Carrow pursed his lips.
 “Yes… I think so.
 You are the only one who can credibly promise such gifts to the Thai.
 They won't step out ahead of China, for fear of being left alone in the
 cold, but they will drag their feet as much as they may.
 The Ten Thousand are never quick on the stick, but I don't believe we need
 to worry about them joining the ranks of our enemies, any time soon.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The dragons’ heads on top of the samovar opened their mouths, hissing twin
 streams of steam.
 Their eyes glowed a dull red.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Draco walked to one of the room’s tall windows, and stood there for a moment,
 looking out at the night.
 He could see one of the towers of 
\emph on
The Declaration of Intent
\emph default
, and it was a sharp reminder of the importance of the stewardship of assets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“We will give them nothing they can use -- ideas of promise, but no application.
 Dead ends,” said Draco.
 “A taste of power, but nothing to tip our hand or upset the balance in
 the Ten Thousand.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“They aren't fools, my boy,” said Carrow.
 “They won't be so easily misled.
 If a bitch will bear no pups, you don't just cut its throat… you also give
 your elf a lesson with the knife.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Draco thought of Dobby, and smirked.
 “If an elf is left so poorly trained, then there’s no one to blame but
 yourself.” He reversed Carrow's metaphor, making it more to his liking:
 “We will throw a treat to our foreign friends.
 The Thais, the Russians, those Americans… old allies and new, they’ll learn
 the potential power of joining us.
 We have people within the Tower and in the Department of Mysteries to assist.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Such as Umbridge won't get you what we need,” said Carrow, stroking his
 chin.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Stolen secrets won't be the sole bait.
 There will also be simple advancements harvested from the Muggles.
 There is remarkable power in these techniques… power that will astonish
 even you, Amycus,” said Draco, turning to the side and regarding Carrow
 again.
 “The principles of Mendel can reshape the flesh of beasts in a fashion
 more safe and more stable than even the feats of the fabled sarkamancers
 of the Eleusinian Mysteries.
 You think it is an accident that Loony Lovegood is meddling with Devil’s
 Snare? The methods behind her madness are a coin for us, too.” He snapped
 his fingers.
 “And we will also buy trust with deceit.
 Already and at this very moment, I am acting to set up a rival to the Honourabl
e -- a rival that will conspicuously fail, and in the process cost our erstwhile
 allies any investment they might make.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Your lovely mother...
 she's off selecting your chosen fools,” said Amycus, nodding slowly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Taking a meeting -- she is considerably enthused about the project.
 I believe it amuses her to hand-craft a rival.
 Traps made of people are an elegant thing.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I would have been able to assist in this, had I known ahead of time, my
 boy.” Carrow folded his hands in front of himself, tilting his head slightly
 to the side.
 His right eye twitched.
 “A mistake.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Draco’s expression became cold, and his eyes narrowed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Carrow stared back, unblinking.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was a long pause.
 Then Draco drew a breath, and spoke with cold care.
 “You presume too much, 
\emph on
Carrow
\emph default
.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Gregory stood up a little straighter, and squared his shoulders; a subtle
 and appreciated signal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Draco turned to face Carrow, and brought his palms together in front of
 himself.
 He drew them apart across his chest, and as they parted, his father’s cane
 appeared in the gap, growing as Draco spread his hands, until the Lord
 Malfoy could grasp the snake-headed silver handle and bring the other end
 down to the floorboards with a sharp crack.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Draco raised his voice, beginning loudly, all thunder and lightning “
\emph on
I am
\emph default
 Draco Malfoy, and I… I...”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
His voice trailed off.
 Draco lowered his gaze.
 He fell silent.
 He let his shoulders slump slightly, as though the wind had been taken
 from his sails.
 He stood like that, and held it.
 Waited.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Lord Malfoy?” asked Gregory, hesitantly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“No,” said Draco.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Gregory drew a sharp breath.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Draco raised his eyes again, glancing at Gregory.
 “No,” he said again.
 “This is too important.
 It is too important for grandstanding.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then he met Carrow’s eyes with a steady gaze, and his voice was quiet.
 “No speeches, no grandeur, no orders.
 I tell you here tonight, Amycus Carrow, that this is the sticking point
 for a hundred generations of wizardkind.
 If we fail, then the world will be a darker and sadder place.” Draco thought
 of a silver light he’d once seen… a pure glow that had overturned so many
 lies with its very existence, filling him with such an argent awe that
 it changed his world in a heartbeat.
 He imagined that light gone forever, and let that sorrow fill his voice.
 “If we fail -- if we let one trick slip by or fall short by an ounce of
 wit, then our world will become a Muggle-made thing of immortal monsters.
 We are confronting an existential threat: a looming power that might not
 only end us, but end everything we hold dear.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He shook his head.
 “So no threats and no foolishness.
 If you don't have the mettle to hold to your place and do your part, even
 when it harms your pride, well -- go, and may your chains sit lightly upon
 you.” He raised his cane -- a mere symbol and a powerless prop, but wasn't
 persuasion the mightiest thing of all? -- and he pointed it at Carrow.
 “But if you have honour, and you’re with us… then you are 
\emph on
with us
\emph default
, and you will 
\emph on
heed your place
\emph default
.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Apophasis
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before he’d even finished speaking, Carrow had fallen to one knee.
 “I can offer nothing but my apology and my fealty, Lord Malfoy.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Gregory looked as satisfied as the kneazle that caught the cracklebit.
 He crossed his arms, and a smile lurked at the corner of his mouth.
 He looked a foot taller.
 He looked like faith fulfilled.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Master,” said Dobby, emerging from behind a different curtain.
 “Your visitors are here.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Let them in,” said Draco, without taking his gaze off of Carrow.
 Dobby disappeared back behind the curtain once more.
 Draco lowered his cane.
 “Goyle, go meet them.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Goyle left, his face revealing barely-disguised triumph.
 The story of this moment would travel.
 Draco smiled.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Carrow and Draco were alone.
 There was only the quiet hiss of steam, rising dangerously from twin dragon
 heads, to keep them company.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Bah,” said Carrow, rising off of his knee and standing up again.
 He snatched out his wand and as he waggled it, almost too fast to follow,
 the warm crackle of wards settled on around them.
 Privacy screens, above and beyond the ones that already layered the Manor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Draco didn't say anything -- didn't rub it in.
 There was no need.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Try that again, Malfoy,” he said, glowering, “and you will get a rather
 different reaction.
 Goyle will be spreading the story of how you lost an ear, instead.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Draco watched him coolly.
 “And damage everything we've been building? You have more discipline than
 that.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Maybe.
 But also too much discipline to be afraid to upset the applecart, if need
 be,” replied Carrow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Before you do, be quite certain it’s worth it.
 One only gets one chance at ruining plans like these.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Plans like these? Your mother is setting up some small circle of idiots
 to take a fall, sucking some Cappadocian money with them as they go, eh?
 Helping build up the Honourable to draw in all the enemy?” said Carrow.
 He stabbed a finger at Draco.
 “Or is it a cover for your own efforts to set up an independent base of
 power?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I’m not above a fall-back plan, Mad-eye,” said Draco, “because I am not
 an idiot.
 If something happens to Harry, or he goes too far, or anything else… well,
 I don't intend to wager everything on one game of pitch-and-toss.
 But my fall-back lies in the Honourable: they are my ‘independent’ base
 of power, if need be, not some momentary troop of patsies.
 That is why the Honourable are loyal to me, personally.
 Harry knows that.
 You know that.
 And you both understand it, too, I think.” He fixed Carrow with a harsh
 look.
 “Don't pretend to purity.
 I know you have your own private plans.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Not that he 
\emph on
knew
\emph default
, really, but there could not be a safer assumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“There’s a difference between preparation and betrayal,” said Carrow, in
 a most un-Carrow-like growl.
 “Which are you at, I wonder?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“
\emph on
Continue
\emph default
 to wonder,” pronounced Draco, curtly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Aye,” said Carrow, slowly.
 “Well.
 You may believe you can bludger Potter in the back, if you get the opportunity.
 And maybe you’re right.
 He’s clever, but soft.
 He trusts you.
 But I don't.” Carrow gave Draco a hard stare, and his very face was a reminder
 of his capacity for subterfuge.
 “But be careful thinking you can play a deeper game than me, boy.
 Many have tried...
 and gotten no deeper than six feet.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Lord Draco Malfoy,” said Gregory, opening the door across the room, “of
 the Noble and Most Ancient House of Malfoy, Britain’s last and best defender
 of the honour of wizardkind and the fate of magic.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Draco turned to regard the door, cane in hand, and his face slid into a
 courteous smile of welcome.
 Three men with hard faces but indifferent grooming stepped into the room
 ahead of Gregory.
 They had the weighty air of importance.
 One of them wore a brooch of emeralds-and-alicorn, while another openly
 carried an old wand of the Slavic style, two feet long and bladed.
 They all wore the red woollen cloaks of Russian domovoi: the decision-makers
 of one of the great peoples in the wizarding world, no less magisterial
 than the Wizengamot.
 These were men who had held lives in their hands, who had scrutinized their
 subjects down to the curve of their soul, who had begun and ended wars
 as they saw fit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now they were come to Malfoy Manor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Carrow and Goyle walked over to stand beside Draco.
 Draco’s smile broadened.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Please, gentlemen,” he said.
 “Sit wherever you like.”
\end_layout
