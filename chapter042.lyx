The same day
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“There,” said Meldh, lifting his hand from Harry’s wrist.
 “Think back, and see if you can remember anything.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry shut his eyes, standing silently.
 It was very quiet in the blank span of corridor where they stood, near
 the rear of the Tower – there were no distractions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After a while, Harry opened his eyes again.
 “No, sir.
 I can’t remember anything about where Voldemort might be.
 And I seem to remember all about the Tower departments, otherwise.
 There’s no obvious gap that might provide a clue.” He paused.
 “Thank you, sir, for leaving me with everything else.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“It seemed cruel to take all of that away from you,” said Meldh, nodding.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Thank you, sir,” said Harry, smiling.
 His smile faded, though, as he said hesitantly, “Sir, before we go back
 to the others, I think we should talk about your succession to my place
 – at least in the broad strokes, so I can begin thinking about how to help.
 I know that you believe the Lethe Touch to be infallible, but there’s no
 reason to risk it.
 It’s basic information hygiene.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Meldh waved a hand, dismissively.
 “There is no concern.
 I will take your identity and you will become a new person.
 We will alter the trajectory you have chosen for the world, using the tools
 you have put at my command.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“No, sir,” Harry said, shaking his head.
 “There are serious problems there.
 For one, the new terminal values you’ve given us are too…” He fumbled for
 words.
 “There’s too much internal conflict, sir.
 It shows on our faces, and it will lead to strange behavior at some point.
 It will be like an Asimov story with the Three Laws… outside observers
 will be able to deduce from aberrant behavior that there are new underlying
 rules.
 Many people are very loyal to me, but no one is 
\emph on
absolutely
\emph default
 loyal, to the extent where my will and wishes are their most important
 goals.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“We have taken dozens of your allies here, but I have set up a pressure
 within them,” Meldh said.
 “They are enchanted in the same fashion as yourself, but there is a capacity
 for release by recasting the Touch and adding –”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“No!” said Harry, abruptly, holding up his hand.
 “I don’t need to know! Information hygiene.” Sheepishly, he lowered his
 hand, smiling a bit.
 “Sorry, sir, but there’s no need to tell me the command word… it can’t
 possibly help.
 Yes, you can trust me absolutely, right now, but what if I were to get
 free somehow? The best weapon you’d have in that situation would be your
 control of almost all of my closest friends… I’m going to be substantially
 weaker if any attack on you risks killing Draco or Moody – or even if your
 death would just leave all of my friends as your servants, forever.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Do not worry, Mr.
 Potter,” said Meldh, kindly.
 “There is no risk that you will go free.
 No one has ever defeated the Lethe Touch by sheer willpower, and there
 is no spell known to you or any of your allies that could dispel the enchantmen
t.
 We now possess the only real trust that can ever exist between two people.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“What about my Unbreakable Vow, sir?” asked Harry.
 “It’s an obvious problem… what if you ask me to do something that might
 destroy the world?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Meldh folded his hands in his sleeves.
 “You will not be able to comply, of course.
 But the results would be the same if I asked you to fetch me a Lethifold’s
 smile– you could not do it, but neither would the Touch fail.
 I spent some time examining your mind, Mr.
 Potter, and I assure you that there is no power known to you that poses
 a threat to me.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry fell silent, and leaned back against the wall of the corridor.
 Meldh waited, patiently.
 After a time, Harry spoke up again, saying, “When I think about possible
 contingency plans for something like this, it seems obvious I would have
 prepared something and stored the memory in a Pensieve, or just erased
 it with such care as to leave no traces.
 Of course, if I thought of a contingency once, I should be able to think
 of it again, so it would also be necessary to erase the memories that led
 me to the plan in the first place.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Then we’re no better off for the wondering,” said Meldh, chuckling mildly.
 “You cannot worry or defend against the unknown, since it can take any
 shape.
 The key to great strength is defending against every known, whether it
 appears a threat or not, and staying 
\emph on
hidden
\emph default
 from the unknown.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I disagree, sir.
 It’s possible to plan for the unknown – you can make a path for it or put
 in place some contingency that embraces a host of possibilities.
 And I am fairly sure that I must have at least 
\emph on
tried
\emph default
 to do so.
 The way magic works, it was never an outlandish idea that someone old and
 powerful might show up and take offense.
 I knew for certain that people like Nicholas Flamel were out there.
 Given the long history of the world and the fact that magic was once much
 more powerful, it was actually more likely than not that there would be
 some immortals out there.” Harry shrugged.
 “I should have perhaps even foreseen you yourself, sir.
 The inventor of the Horcrux spell? It seems obvious, in retrospect.
 Maybe I 
\emph on
did
\emph default
 foresee it, actually.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Meldh looked amused.
 “You and Voldemort share the same opinion of your abilities.
 You will forgive me for saying that I do not, Mr.
 Potter.
 My victory was not a difficult one, and cost scarcely even a pawn’s worth
 of trouble.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry shrugged.
 “That seems suspicious to me, sir.” Then he opened his mouth, as though
 to go on speaking, but made no sound.
 He grimaced and shook his head, accidentally rapping it against the wall
 and wincing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Meldh watched him, and replied to the unaskable question.
 “No, Mr.
 Potter,” he said gently.
 “I do not think it is necessary to kill you now, out of fear of some possible
 trap you’ve laid.
 Rather, I will need your help.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Once I take my place as the new Mr.
 Potter, you will be by my side in some altered shape, as an adjunct and
 adviser,” he said.
 “I will release all others – they will continue to serve ‘you,’ and the
 Tower will move in a new direction to 
\emph on
decisively
\emph default
 end magic.
 Your Muggle knowledge will be turned to proper ends… without your foolishness.”
 He chortled, amiably.
 “Some things can even be done immediately, to help stave off the end of
 the world and its people.
 There is at least one new ritual we may enact, based on your knowledge.
 To think what you would have let go to waste – for the sake of some distant
 bits of fire!”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry looked at the ground, his face uncomfortable.
 “Sir, I considered it to be immoral, especially when there are alternatives
 that don’t increase entropy in the universe so much.
 And…” Harry fumbled over his words clumsily, as though many ideas were
 fighting for expression at the same time.
 “And many stars have the possibility of life, either now or in the future,
 and that risk is so apocalyptically bad that it overwhelms any benefit
 to an individual life here, and when we reach the second type on the Kardashev
 scale we’ll then be confronted with a loss of useful energy on a scale
 of… of… well, I don’t even know how to make a comparison! Obviously it
 would be like sacrificing our own Sun, but… well, it would be like a wiping
 out every scrap of phoenix flame that ever existed and could ever exist,
 all to save one person.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
His voice wasn’t rising, but it was filled with strange tension, as though
 he weren’t arguing with Meldh, but were arguing with himself.
 He kept talking, though, fumbling through in a rush.
 “And we might not even need to do that! The Advancement Agency has made
 amazing strides in only a few years.
 With reconfiguring parts alone, they’ll raise life expectancy.
 The prostate, the heart, the optic nerve, the retina, the spine, the knees,
 the teeth… there are all sorts of design fixes that will reduce the chances
 of morbidity.
 Making them a part of the standard rejuvenation and putting in greater
 security – even perhaps with the aid of the Touch, sir – will put us well
 ahead of the curve on a new Moore’s Law of lifespan.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“No,” said Meldh, flatly...
 that short and curt blade of a word.
 “We will not wait, not when the new ritual will be so simple to devise
 – with some little study of your Muggle knowledge about the stars.
 Not one more minute, as the saying goes.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry choked a little in his throat, then hung his head, and made no reply.
 He stared at the floor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“To think I feared to come here, considering it an unwarranted risk,” marveled
 Meldh, shaking his head and gesturing down the corridor.
 “Come.
 We must arrange for the death of the fallen bishop, Bellatrix Black, and
 take what actions are necessary to suborn the absentee goblins, and set
 them, too, on the correct path.” He smiled at the thought.
 “Then I have some preparations to make before I step outside of this Tower
 to consult with my allies.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry began moving obediently, and they began walking back to the meeting
 room.
 Meldh glanced at him, and spoke, his voice kind.
 “The new immortals of the world, the ones that we choose to aid us in our
 cause, will have cause to praise my risk and your losses, Mr.
 Potter.
 There are endless stars in the sky… more than enough for every witch and
 wizard we might select.”

“You have succeeded… well done,” said the third figure – Nell.
 Her congratulations were light and pleasant, but none the more convincing
 for that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Thank you,” said the first figure – Meldh.
 “We have swept the board.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second figure said nothing, only watching them both.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“You have Touched the boy-king… will you leave him in charge?” asked Nell.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“No,” said Meldh.
 “I will take his shape and his identity.
 He has built a formidable apparatus, and I think that few threats now exist
 that could stand against it.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“You do not think that you might be, perhaps, overconfident? Is your control
 already so sure?” asked Nell.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Meldh paused and did not reply for a time.
 The second figure, silent still, turned a face of slithering shadow to
 regard him, watching intently.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“My pride prompts me to deny you, but 
\emph on
mirgo que n'a qu'un trpu est bientôt prise
\emph default
… yes, perhaps you are correct,” said Meldh, finally.
 “Mr.
 Potter himself said as much to me, not an hour ago.
 I had thought to use the goblins as an excuse to change policy, but even
 a goblin army may not be sufficient to rouse enough alarm and stem the
 suspicion of his allies.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“If you require further assistance, then you shall have it,” said the second
 figure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“We are gambling a great deal,” agreed Nell.
 “You shall have every support we can offer.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Then so be it,” said Meldh.
 “I will not turn away one ounce of assistance.
 And for my part, I find that I will not have need of the Stone of the Long
 Song, so long as you would still be willing to lend its power on occasion,
 Madame.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Of course,” said Nell, and the shadows writhed in some distant imitation
 of a smile.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“No,” said the second figure.
 “That shall not be sufficient.
 Now is not the time for conservative policies.
 We must take this opportunity to act.
 Our hand is in play – we will make it a fist.
 Now is the time to act.
 We will do as we have not done in many years.
 Sontag once thrived and threatened, rich on the concentrated lore of the
 Peverells, and made a perfect plum to be plucked.
 You fear preparations against you? Let us swamp them in violence.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Is that not hasty?” asked Meldh.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even Nell seemed startled by the proposition.
 “I will commit all to the enterprise, if necessary, but I think –”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“We will raise mighty forces.
 Armies.
 I will act with all puissance at my command,” said the second figure, as
 though the others had not spoken.
 “Not only the goblins, strong with the restored knowledge of their ancient
 will-work.
 Also the visc and lejis of this place will take breath again, driven by
 the gaunt-horrors.
 I will break the cycle of the unsleeping, and bring forth your long-vanished
 terrasque and basilisks.
 Muggles in their hordes will take the eaters on themselves.
 They will march, we will sacrifice many… and take the opportunity to wipe
 away the magics of London, Boston, and Hangzhou.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I am not sure that…” said Nell, hesitantly.
 “We have not acted on such a scale since…” She shook her head, darkness
 swirling.
 “Never.
 This is audacity truly worthy of Merlin.
 And unspeakably risky.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Thus shall it be, Perenelle du Marais,” said the second figure.
 He did not wait for a reply, but turned to Meldh, and stated, “Thus shall
 it be, Heraclius Hero.
 We will sweep the world with discord and blood, crush a thousand artifacts
 and burn a thousand scrolls, and raise such fear as has never been seen.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was a desperately long pause, when none of them moved.
 They were not the sort to act in haste, despite the brutal decisiveness
 they could bring to a conversation.
 All Three waited, patiently, for each of the others to think through and
 come to terms with the new shape of the world to come.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tentatively, Nell said, “In the face of such a threat, those remaining wizards
 will unite behind the Tower.
 Behind you.” She looked back at Meldh.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Behind 
\emph on
us
\emph default
,” corrected Meldh, mildly.
 “And I think we will have no resistance, then, in a push to redouble the
 Statute of Secrecy’s strictures and limit the scope and growth of magic.
 The plan will need further thought to arrange all of the pieces, but there
 will be resources to spare, now that I have mastered the Tower.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“You disposed of Bellatrix Black and Voldemort,” said the second figure
 – a question that was not really a question.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I have made arrangements for the death of the Black woman, but there are...
 complications with Voldemort.
 I actually have much to say to you about Horcruxes at another time.
 I have sealed Voldemort away, however, and erased all memory of his hiding
 place.
 It will suffice, I think,” said Meldh.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Kill Potter, as well,” said the second figure.
 “Whatever his lore, the risk is too great.
 And we need no more 
\emph on
complications
\emph default
.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“As you wish, although the odd patterns of his brain have been fruitful,”
 said Meldh, untroubled.
 “I will strip his mind of what else might be gleaned, and then end him.”
 He inclined his head, gently.
 “I will send signal for our next meeting presently, after concluding such
 matters.
 We will plan for our war and arrange our pieces.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Yes,” said the second figure.
 “Consider, each of you, the utmost of your might.
 We will spare no energy or lore in the conflict to come.
 Victory must be certain for us to take such a risk.”

The afternoon of the same day
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Upon his return to the Tower, Meldh appeared tired.
 He walked with heavy feet out of the annex next to the Receiving Room,
 where he’d performed the ritual.
 His fingers were still bloody, wet with the necessary components of a trip
 to the land of the Unseelie.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a moment, the assured and calm wizard was gone.
 He looked the same… dusky skin, dark eyes, broad lips.
 But he looked weary and battered, and it was enough to bring a worried
 Moody to his side with gruff but concerned questions.
 Meldh waved away the Tower’s spymaster, and stepped through the golden
 oval of the Tower entrance.
 Harry waited just inside, frowning and unhappy, accompanied by Diggory.
 Both young men looked immensely relieved to see their master alive, though
 their worried glances at each other showed their distress at his state.

“Sir, we’re holding some people in Material Methods,” said Diggory, speaking
 first.
 He and Harry walked along with Meldh down the corridor, slowly, towards
 the clinic.
 “Madame Bones, Percy Weasley, Councilor Reg Hig, and seven aurors reporting
 for their normal shifts.
 All stunned and waiting for you.
 And there is regular Tower business… people to heal.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Good, good,” said Meldh, vaguely.
 “Harry shall go and attend to healing.
 But I must rest.
 Keep the prisoners stunned and secured for now.
 All else is well?”
\end_layout

“Ackle and Curd have both sent away emissaries from Minister N’goma,” said
 Harry, studying Meldh closely.
 “And Hermione Granger sent a message to let me know she’d be here this
 evening.
 All is well with your allies?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Fine,” said Meldh.
 He sighed, heavily.
 “Ah, but… forgive my weariness, but there is such 
\emph on
violence
\emph default
 in the offing, Mr.
 Potter.
 I confess that I did not anticipate it, and the very thought makes me ache
 for my garden and my home and my temple.
 I fear I will not see them for a great while, and that is not a discomfort
 I have needed to endure for many years.” He shook his head.
 Harry touched him on the arm, reassuringly, and the older wizard glanced
 down at the hand and smiled a small smile.

“Sir, I’m sorry, but we should prepare for Granger,” said Diggory, breaking
 in on the moment.
 “She is resourceful and her Returned are insane.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I am too tired, young man,” said Meldh.
 “Mr.
 Potter, make plans accordingly.” He sighed again.
 “I must rest.
 There will be war soon, and the world will shake because of it.
 A great and fearsome god calls for blood.
 That is not something I have seen for centuries.
 I must rest and think.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry took hold of Diggory’s arm, restraining him, and they stopped in their
 tracks.
 Meldh continued on, moving slowly.
 He vanished from sight into the clinic.

“This is for the best, Cedric,” said Harry.
 “I’m not sure that he would be able to appreciate the threat that Hermione
 could present, but we do.
 Let’s make a plan.”
