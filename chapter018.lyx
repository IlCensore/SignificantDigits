\begin_layout Standard
Harry Potter-Evans-Verres, Percy Weasley, Haddad, Podrut, and Mafalda Hopkirk
 relaxed.
 Amelia Bones, Cedric Diggory, Hedley Kwannon, Simon Smith, and Alastor
 Moody did not.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry sighed.
 “If it's all secure, and it was just students trying to Gryffindor their
 way into someplace secure, then let's finish up here.
 We were talking about the Seyhan thing.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Diggory handed his bubbler to Auror Kwannon, gesturing with his other hand
 at the door.
 “Keep tabs on things, and let me know if they need help sorting through
 the backlog in Receiving.
 Oh, and have someone notify the Headmistress, since it's students.
 This is happening too often.” She nodded and spent a few moments dispelling
 the wards on the door until she was able to quietly exit, small mirror
 in hand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Everyone else sat down around the meeting table again, gathering up parchments
 where they'd been scattered.
 Harry tapped his finger thoughtfully, and said, “All right… so Moody will
 take the lead in planning out how to handle this -- the logistics of the
 fake body.
 This could badly hurt us if it gets out, increasing the paranoia and driving
 even more people into the Independents, so not a word about this outside
 of this room.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He turned to regard Simon Smith.
 “That means with Hermione, too.
 I'll discuss it with her the next time I see her -- tonight, I think --
 and we'll work out how to handle this with the Returned.” He wasn't actually
 worried about any leaks from them; the loyalty and security of the Returned
 was so absolute in its nature that it approached the surety of magical
 vows.
 It wasn't quite a cult, but something about the nature of their suffering
 and redemption instilled in them an otherworldly certainty in Hermione's
 judgment and goodness.
 “And I'll also work out with her how to put some distance between you guys
 and the Tower.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Smith nodded.
 “She will also want to talk with Madame Bones,” he said.
 “Charlevoix has received word from Ministre Isidore about a possible pen
 for Dementors in Siberia.
 We understand that there could be political consequences when we crush
 it, and we want to minimize that.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“We might be able to use that, actually,” said Madame Bones, wrinkling her
 smooth brow thoughtfully.
 She lifted a hand to curtail Smith before he could object, adding, “Although
 I know you won't delay in acting by even one minute, of course.
 Nor should you.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She turned to Harry.
 “Things are coming to a turning point, I think, Harry.
 Draco and Narcissa are pushing their treaty with as much energy as they
 can muster, warning that every state must choose between us and them.
 Well, not ‘them' in as many words -- they're saying it's the only way to
 prevent invasion.
 Your ‘bend like the willow' strategy may be reaching the end of its usefulness…
 I say we start pushing back a little more.
 We can't let the Malfoys define us in the eyes of world powers.
 And if Hermione is going to back off on her tours and advocacy, then it's
 especially important that we speak for ourselves.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“She's right, Potter,” said Moody, scratching the scalp of today's body.
 “The time for the soft sell is over, especially if you can't have the Goddess
 out there selling us to the world.
 You've been telling us you have some ‘breakthroughs' that will end Malfoy's
 little rebellion for years, and in the meantime the blonde little nit has
 become a hundredfold more threatening to your goals.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Let's cut off distribution of Malfoy's newsletter, at least,” chimed in
 Diggory.
 “He uses our Vanishing Rooms to trans-ship to the Americas, Eastern Europe,
 Africa, and the Ten Thousand.
 If we just cut off those lines, then it's going to be bloody hard for him
 to get his nonsense out there.
 He'll be back to the old ways.
 Even you've called this a war… let's really get our army moving!”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I wouldn't rely too much on Vanishing Rooms staying our own exclusive property,
” said Harry.
 “Plenty of people have all kinds of opportunity to examine the Rooms in
 other states, and it wasn't that much of a leap from Vanishing Cabinets.
 A few tweaks to the 
\emph on
Passus
\emph default
 and they've got it -- assuming they haven't stolen the incantations already.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moody harrumphed his agreement.
 “At least twelve questionable researchers on staff in Extension Establishment
 and Pairing Partnership alone.” He pointed a crooked finger at Mafalda Hopkirk.
 “The Unspeakables leak like a sieve.” She scowled, cheeks flushing, but
 Moody was already turning back to Harry.
 “And you have that Umbridge toad in and out of here like she owns the place!
 I don't know what you're doing with all that Muggle rubbish in Pairing
 Partnership, churning out reams of squiggly lines while casting first-year
 cantrips, but if it's important enough for you to be researching yourself,
 then Umbridge shouldn't be allowed anywhere near it.
 She shouldn't even know it 
\emph on
exists
\emph default
!”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“You don't know her value,” said Harry.
 “I do.
 She and the other people you suspect -- 
\emph on
suspect
\emph default
, since you don't have a shred of evidence or you'd already have told me
 -- are all essential.
 The risk to operational security is outweighed by our need for speed… they
 have to work all the harder to make themselves useful to me, after all.
 In a month, we'll be able to put the sliceboxes to use properly, and that's
 only because of the help of some of your ‘questionable researchers.'” He
 turned back to Diggory.
 “And you're not cutting off freedom of the press, either.
 Everyone gets to 
\emph on
say
\emph default
 whatever they want.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“That doesn't stop us from replying, at least,” said Diggory.
 A frown appeared on his ridiculously handsome face.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He cut off the train of thought before it could proceed much further.
 “Fair point.
 We have regular announcements and releases in 
\emph on
The Prophet
\emph default
, but it might shift the Overton window more if we also had our own newsletter.
 Percy, maybe you could come up with a few names on who might head that
 up?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Weasley nodded, making notes on the parchment in front of him.
 “I have a few people in mind.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Thank Merlin for small favors,” groused Bones.
 “I'd like one of my people on that, too.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Malfoy's fired off two bombs just last month, and this one's talking about
 ‘freedom of the press,'” muttered Moody, disgruntled with where they'd
 left the topic.
 “Going to need metal detectors on the Tower entrance, soon.
 Not a bad thought, actually… we can do that, now, with that Loony Leaf...”
 He trailed off, thinking.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry glanced at the agenda in front of him.
 “Moving on, the Westphalians are asking for us to publicly cut all financial
 ties with Cyprus -- I'm guessing that would be to impress Cappadocia with
 their clout, for whatever reason -- and for ‘equality in trade.'”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“In other words, we drop all tariffs and pressure others to do so, as well,”
 said Bones.
 “Old hat from them.
 They've been demanding it for a century.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Yes, and it would be a huge victory if Hig got us to agree to that… it
 would put the Treaty over the top with them, and increase his personal
 prestige.
 If we're cultivating him, that would make sense,” mused Weasley.
 “A big hit to your own popularity here at home, but it would be in sectors
 where we can afford the loss.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“He also wants us to send them some arithmancers to train them in progressive
 taxation,” said Harry, smiling.
 “The secret to our wealth.
 But if we agree to that… well, Hig has laid that out as non-negotiable
 before they'll recommend the Treaty.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Once they recommend it, it's as good as passed in the United States and
 Canada,” commented Haddad.
 The Chief Goldsmith pulled an ornate snuffbox from a small pocket in his
 jacket, loading the crook of his index finger with a pinch.
 “Probably a few other countries in the Americas, as well.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Yes, it's common knowledge they own the north, sure enough,” said Bones,
 thoughtfully.
 “But Dumbledore thought -- and I agree with him -- that they could swing
 almost all of the Americas around like a toy kneazle.
 He was uncomfortable with that aspect of American affairs, even as he needed
 to work with their people in the Confederation to keep things in check.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Yes, I'm inclined to agree.
 I think we should make the deal, if we can.
 We'll get on the wing to other major signatories, and make sure we have
 a majority in favor, though,” Harry said.
 “If we jump on this, it might forestall them using the Independent situation
 even more to their advantage.
 I honestly still think they could go either way.
 We need to lock the Council down… their intelligence operation is invaluable.
 Particularly given our current situation.
 We can worry about dismantling it after we understand what we're up against.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Even with the mysterious ‘Three' in play,” asked Moody, “they'd still consider
 staying neutral?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“There are some people in the Council who like the idea of three world coalition
s -- Independents, Health and Life, and Westphalia.
 Councilor Strongbound has been trying to put together enough votes to get
 Westphalia to reject any motion to endorse us, playing it as another move
 by imperialist Britain to take control.
 He's echoing a lot of Malfoy talk.” Harry said.
 “Hig leads the majority there, but he doesn't own the Council of Westphalia
 as thoroughly as they own the politics of the States.
 He's with us, I think, but he's not everyone.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the doors opened, and Kraeme entered the room, Pip at her side.
 He had a slip of parchment in hand.
 “Sir? We thought you should see this.
 One of the intruders today had it, but it doesn't appear to be any language
 we recognize.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“A code, or just another part of the prank meant to look like a code,” added
 Kraeme.
 “They had a sackful of transfigured doxies and a transfigured Vanishing
 Cabinet, too.
 And one of these,” she said, holding up a small wooden abacus.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Someone's in 
\emph on
trouble
\emph default
,” said Harry, whistling and raising his eyebrows.
 “Okay, they got my attention.
 Bring them in here, and ask the Headmistress to join us if she's free.”
 He glanced around.
 “I think we've covered nearly everything -- everything high-security, anyway.
 Percy will have some owls out to everyone about a few more things, but
 it's nothing we can't solve later or at a distance.
 Bones, you'll be in Norden for a week from tomorrow, yes?” She nodded as
 she got to her feet, shuffling parchments into a pile.
 “I'll owl you about some things, then.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Everyone departed their separate ways, exchanging cordial pleasantries as
 they did so.
 Most headed to the entrance to the Tower, so they could get a portkey out
 of Hogwarts, while Podrut went back to Material Methods.
 Moody stayed behind long enough to kill a fly he'd noticed in the room
 with a well-placed curse, then went to check out the situation in the Receiving
 Room.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While Kraeme and Pip went to go bring in the students that had been taken
 prisoner -- placed under arrest? what was the proper terminology? -- Harry
 examined the slip of parchment.

\begin_layout Standard
Could he take the time to break this? It would be fun, but he hadn't done
 cryptography for years… not since he and Draco had come up with the codes
 for the Bayesian Conspiracy, really.
 He smiled at the thought.
 The smile faltered as he glanced at his watch.
 Not much time left before he needed to get to the clinic and finish off
 the Transfigurations that were in progress or in holding.
 The patients might mostly be in magical sleep, unconscious of the passage
 of time, but the healers on duty were not so lucky.
 Clinic time was starting to dominate his daily schedule… they were going
 to have to change protocol, and figure out some way for him to multitask.
 The Stone required no concentration or effort from him, after all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Giving the Stone to someone else -- anyone other than Hermione -- was an
 impossibility, of course.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, he had a few minutes, anyway.
 He took a mechanical pencil from his pocket, turned his agenda over to
 use as scrap paper, and got to work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The opening digits were clearly significant in some way.
 Was it a Caesar cypher, rotating through the alphabet 33 letters (i.e.
 7 letters) one way or another? That would be easy almost beyond belief,
 but this was Magical Britain, and maths hadn't yet penetrated very deep.
 Easy enough to check.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
abjjuptlj
\emph default
… no, that wasn't it, clearly.
 The other way didn't yield up anything intelligible, either.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He counted the letter frequency.
 Every letter in the alphabet appeared at least once in the 156-letter message,
 which reduced the likelihood that it was a rotation cypher or a simple
 substitution.
 If there were spacing between letters, he could have picked out the single-lett
er words to help rule out some possibilities, but this was just an unbroken
 string -- no punctuation, either.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He mapped 
\noun on
etaoin
\noun default
 onto the message's six most common letters, but again there was no discernible
 pattern.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry paused for a moment.
 What were some other novice codes? Or should he take a different tact and
 assume this was someone who knew what they were doing? He'd once thought
 about making a magical Enigma machine, using custom-enchanted quills --
 the theory behind giving quills specific instructions for behavior predicated
 on outside input was voluminous, and it had intrigued him with the possibilitie
s of magical computing, once.
 Harry strained to remember… had he ever discussed it with Draco?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
No, this was found on students.
 Even if someone skilled at cryptography had designed this code, it was
 probably still simple enough for a student to decipher with materials at
 hand.
 A one-time pad was a good possibility, given the digits at the start of
 the code.
 In that case, the code was unbreakable without the thirty-third sheet from
 the necessary pad.
 He'd assume that wasn't the case for now, though.
 More fun this way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A book cipher? The Bible would normally be the obvious choice -- Genesis
 3:3 would be the place to start -- but that was unlikely in a magical society,
 where religion had limited currency.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry wasn't as well-equipped in the magical culture department as most
 other wizards, but a few alternatives sprang to mind: 
\emph on
The Tales of Beedle the Bard
\emph default
, 
\emph on
Goshawk's Book of Spells
\emph default
, 
\emph on
Lowe's The Muggle Conspiracy
\emph default
, or something by Bagshot… there were a variety of books that had been bestselle
rs for so long they'd become ubiquitous.
 In that case, 33 might be the page number or the paragraph used for the
 encoding.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The door opened, and Harry looked up to see the pair of aurors back, three
 children floating along behind them.
 A healer came just behind, wand resting firmly on the chest of one of the
 airborne students.
 Harry felt a little unhappy with himself, even though he knew that was
 silly.
 He'd eliminated several possibilities, and it was clear the cryptogram
 was sufficiently sophisticated that he shouldn't have expected to break
 it with pencil and paper in only a few minutes.
 Still, he'd been expecting some… flash of insight.
 He sighed and put down the pencil, pulling on his fingerless gloves.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Kwannon was also dragging the burlap sack filled with dead doxies, which
 she left on the floor.
 She put an abacus and three wands on the table.
 “Left the Cabinet back in the Receiving Room… Chief Moody insisted,” she
 said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry nodded, approaching the third child.
 He rested a hand on the boy's leg, examining him.
 “He was injured?” he asked the healer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Yes,” replied the man, a tall and slender fellow with a beaky nose.
 “Tears along the ligamentum teres hepatis and mesentery, cardiac contusions,
 pulmonary contusions, multiple fractures, and e-ax bleed.
 Fixed the brain, then got him trip-
\noun on
r
\noun default
, and everything bagged again.
 Trauma was all severe but typical.
 Subsumed some nodules on the thyroid, too, so he'll leave here with some
 salt.
 Kid's been stepped down for about...
 five minutes.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry nodded.
 Serious injuries from blunt trauma, including a ruptured liver, damaged
 intestine, bruising of the heart, and bleeding in the brain… the boy was
 lucky that the Tower and Safety Sticks existed.
 He probably wouldn't have died under Madame Pomfrey's care, but he'd probably
 have suffered brain damage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He studied the boy's face, and then the faces of the two other students,
 but didn't recognize them.
 Hm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Auror Kwannon, were all four things -- abacus, doxies, Vanishing Cabinet,
 and the note -- found on the same student?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The auror nodded.
 “Yes.
 The injured one, here.
 The other two seem to have just been the ones to break the Stick and bring
 him to the Receiving Room.” She paused, lowering her head in thought until
 her shoulder-length black hair swung forward to cover her face, and then
 looked up again, asking, “How could this work, as an attack? The doxies
 are clever -- you're stunned, and they revert to their native Form and
 go on the attack for a few minutes, until they drop dead -- but if you've
 figured out that much, you should also have figured out that the Vanishing
 Cabinet would also revert, and that you wouldn't be able to smuggle it
 into the Tower.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry couldn't repress a slight smile.
 He smelled a clever plot from a novice plotter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He lifted his hand from the injured boy.
 “You can go, Galen.
 Thank you.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The healer lifted his wand from the boy and put it in his sleeve.
 “Certainly.” He paused.
 “I know this one, by the way.
 The patient.
 He came in with his brother, once.
 He's Sammy Meroveni-Bowles.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Oh.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry raised his eyebrows in surprise.
 “Scarlett Meroveni-Bowles is this boy's mother?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Yes,” said the healer, as he headed out the door.
 “The one always ranting about the Treaty in letters to 
\emph on

.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“She is famous for being a bit of a crackpot about that, isn't she? Hm.
 Wait, Galen… would you mind asking someone on the door to get me whichever
 Arithmancy books available in the library on cryptography?” Harry paused.
 “There should be at least… two, if I remember correctly.
 Although there might have been new acquisitions.”

As it happened, the books were unnecessary.
 By the time Pip appeared at the door with four books in hand, fifteen minutes
 later, the puzzle was solved.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry was able to draw the square from memory: the 
\emph on
tabula recta
\emph default
, one of the most basic and famous ways to use a running-key cipher.
 It was almost five hundred years old, and fairly famous among cryptographers:
 a table that was 26 letters tall and 26 letters long, with each row and
 column beginning one letter further in the alphabet (the first row started
 
\noun on
a, b, c
\noun default
 … , the second column was 
\noun on
b, c, d
\noun default
 …, etc).
 It was a simple and elementary way to use a specific key to encode your
 text.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was no 33rd part to the Treaty for Health and Life, and so Harry guessed
 that the third part of the third section -- that is, 3.3 -- was the indicated
 key.
 It took less than a minute to verify with the first six letters of the
 cryptograph, moving letter by letter through the key.
 He looked in the tabula recta for the 
\noun on
a
\noun default
 row, then located the cyphertext letter 
\noun on
t
\noun default
 in that row.
 That 
\noun on
t
\noun default
 was in column 
\noun on

\noun default
, and so the first decoded letter was 
\noun on

.
 Next he found the coded
