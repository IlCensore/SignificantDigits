The Boy-Who-Lived was raised by Petunia Evans and her husband, Oxford professor
 of physics Michael Verres.
 He grew up in a loving home and was raised to revere the scientific method
 and its results.
 When he discovered he was a wizard, Harry Potter-Evans-Verres was shocked
 at the backwards world he found -- a society that was almost feudal, a
 school hardly worthy of the name, and a distinct lack of optimization.
 Harry's quest to rectify these flaws was quickly derailed by the plotting
 of his mentor Professor Quirrell, a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher
 who was actually the Dark Lord Voldemort, and who seeks the Philosopher's
 Stone.

\begin_layout Standard

Working with Hermione Granger and (separately and secretly) with Draco Malfoy,
 Harry did his best to navigate the challenges of his first year: fighting
 in mock battles in Defense class, inventing partial Transfiguration, denouncing
 the abusive Professor Snape, devising a new Patronus that can destroy Dementors
, breaking an innocent out of Azkaban, and angrily pointing out the flaws
 of Quidditch.
 But his worst fears are realized when Hermione is murdered.
 Harry vows that he will keep to the old words of the Potter family...

At the climax of the story, Voldemort's plot to retrieve the Philosopher's
 Stone succeeded.
 In the process, Dumbledore was defeated and banished beyond time, while
 Hermione was resurrected and imbued with the regenerative powers of a troll
 and a unicorn to keep her alive.
 Voldemort revealed that the Philosopher's Stone's power was actually to
 make any Transfiguration permanent, even a human one, and that his overriding
 concern was to prevent a prophecy that predicts Harry will destroy the
 very stars in heaven in his vain questing to optimize the world.
 He further revealed that the curse he cast on Harry as a child left an
 imprint of Voldemort's own thinking on the child, explaining some of Harry's

Calling upon all his ingenuity, Harry used partial Transfiguration to kill
 all of his enemies at a blow, except Voldemort, whom he captured.
 He took up the Stone of Permanency, and returned to school to take control:
 to discover the source of magic, to end the injustices in the world, and
 to destroy death.
